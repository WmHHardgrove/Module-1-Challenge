Horiseon website optimization and debug project

Critera

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title



I was unsure what to change a <div> from lower in th HTML so I left it.  I left it as div as I could only have one main ond none of the other replacements fit.  I used the article https://medium.com/@zac_heisey/7-alternatives-to-the-div-html-tag-7c888c7b5036 for my determination.
